Marketplace for exchange of ERC1155 for ERC20s.

- This project demonstrates a simple marketplace where NFT tickets adhering to the ERC1155 standard can be bought and sold in exchange for a fixed number of ERC20 fungible tokens.

- Features like royalties etc have not been incorporated. But users can buy and sell their tickets any number of times via the marketplace.
